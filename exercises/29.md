### Exercise 29

In the javascript world pretty much everything interesting is asyncronious, even if in some cases (especilly the node standard library) sometimes sync functions are exposed we whould be very worried of blocking a thread, the main problem with blocking is that javascript per se is single threaded so whenever we wait for something in sync we have a stop-all-the-world scenario.

In general blocking threads is not a good idea even in multi-threaded languages and one of the most intresting aspects (out of the scope of this workshop) is using Fibers as lightweight `threads`.

The problem of async programming is not new and there are some different styles you can use to write async code, we will explore in details a generalization provided by the world of functional programming in the following days to abstract both sync and async programs under a coherent syntax.

Until then let's explore the 3 standard patterns, starting with the CPS style.

Let's create a new file called `src/async.ts` and a new file `data/names.txt` containing:

```
Michael
John
Bob
```

### CPS Style

CPS stands for Continuation Passing Style and that as the name suggests means instead of looking for the response of a function we pass a "callback" to it that will deal with the resul, whenever provided.

Let's start with the following:

```ts
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";

fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, "../data/names.txt"), (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log("Got error:", err);
  } else {
    console.log(data.toString("utf-8"));
  }
});
```

We are using `path` from the `node` standard library to join paths and we are using `__dirname` a constant that in `node.js` is populated with the script execution folder.

We are importing the module `fs` from the `node` standard library to read the file we created from the file system.

As we can see we are explicitely passing as a parameter to `readFile` our `continuation` defined using an arrow function taking 2 arguments, an error (potentially undefined) and a response.

### Pro

- bare bone, best perf-possible
- easy to understand in principle
- a good api to generalise on top
- keep types for both error and success channels

### Cons

- callback hell
- very verbose
- illogical
- not easy to follow
- handle errors is hard

### Promise

A `Promise` is a type representing the promise of something that will eventually happend or fail, promises are constructed in the following way:

```ts
new Promise((succeed, fail) => {
  // do stuff
  // call succeed
  // call fail
});
```

Let's wrap the program we wrote in CPS style to return a promise first:

```ts
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";

const promiseOfFileContent = new Promise<string>((succeed, fail) => {
  fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, "../data/names.txt"), (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      fail(err);
    } else {
      succeed(data.toString("utf-8"));
    }
  });
});
```

we can compose the result of `promiseOfFileContent` using `.then()` or we can handle failures with `.catch()`

```ts
promiseOfFileContent
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log("Got error:", err);
  });
```

### Pro

- No callback hell

### Cons

- Type of error is lost
- The data type is eager so you cannot do things like `retry`
- Doesn't look imperative still
- Carry over closure state across multiple steps

### Async / Await

The `async` and `await` is a domain specific language on top of promises, we can define an async functions in two flavors (named and arrow) like:

```ts
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";

async function readFile(path: string) {
  const buffer = await new Promise<Buffer>((succeed, fail) => {
    fs.readFile(path, (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        fail(err);
      } else {
        succeed(data);
      }
    });
  });

  return buffer.toString("utf-8");
}

const main = async () => {
  try {
    const content = await readFile(path.join(__dirname, "../data/names.txt"));

    console.log(content);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Got error:", err);
  }
};

main();
```

An `async` function is basically a function that returns a promise and within the body of the function we can `await` the result of other promises.

We can now easily do multiple things, let's add a new file `data/cities.txt` with the content:

```
London
New York
Rome
```

and let's read that too in the `main` function, logging both `names` and `cities`

### Pros

- looks imperative
- carry state between steps

### Cons

- totally different syntax for sync and async
- error type is still lost

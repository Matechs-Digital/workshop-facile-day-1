### Exercise 23

Record type is used to represent a homogeneous object

```ts
/**
 * Record
 */
export const myRecord: Record<string, string> = {
  a: "a",
  b: "b",
};

export const myRecord2: Record<string, string> = {
  // @ts-expect-error
  a: 1,
  b: "b",
};

export const myRecord3: Record<"b" | "c", string> = {
  // @ts-expect-error
  a: 1,
  b: "b",
};
```

Like for `objects` you can spread records of the same type, like for array there is a readonly variant that you can construct using `Readonly<Record<string, string>>` where mutation will be prohibited.

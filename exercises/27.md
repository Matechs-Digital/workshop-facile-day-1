### Exercise 27

Continuing on the exploration of `type` we will now introduce two very important concepts that represent the begining of an argument that we will constantly get back to from time to time, the concept of Algebraic Data Types, in simple terms an algebraic data type is a type that is computed ad a result of combination of different types.

Let's create a new file called `algebraic.ts`.

### Intersection

First we are going to take a look at type intersections, lets define two `interfaces` as:

```ts
export interface FirstName {
  firstName: string;
}
export interface LastName {
  lastName: string;
}
```

we can define a `Person` like:

```ts
export type Person = FirstName & LastName;
```

and when creating a new person we will be required to provide both the fields of `FirstName` and `LastName`:

```ts
export const person: Person = {
  firstName: "Michael",
  lastName: "Arnaldi",
};
```

The intersection of `primitive` types is idempotent and is constantly never for different types, for example:

```ts
export type IsNever = string & number;
```

Because as you might imagine there is no type which can be `at the same time` both `string` and `number`

### Union

In opposition to intersection types we have `union` types that represent types that can be any of the member of the union,
let's model for example a type that can be either a string or a number.

```ts
export type StringOrNumber = string | number;
```

Let's now define:

```ts
export const myString: StringOrNumber = "ok";
export const myNumber: StringOrNumber = 1;
```

Unions can be made of complex objects, let's begin by defining a `union` type representing a `Asset` that can be either `House` or `Stock`, in case of `House` it contains an address of type string and in the case of `Stock` contains an `ISIN` identifier of type string.

Let's now add in both the types a `initialPrice` and a `currentPrice` and only in case of `Stock` add a field `cumulativeDividends`.

We want now to write a function with the following signature:

```ts
function calculatePL(asset: Asset): number;
```

That return the difference of `currentPrice` and `initialPrice` in both cases but in case of `Stock` includes the `cumulativeDividends`. The function should be written by using custom type guards (the `is` thing) and simple conditional logic like:

```ts
if (condition) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

### Exhaustivity and Tagged Unions

A special case of algebraic types is represented by discriminated unions (sum types) and by discriminated intersections (product types) while in typescript discriminated intersections don't have a predominant usage (apart from some specific cases like cake-like app design that we will explore in details in the future) discriminated union types have a solid use case.

Let's rewrite the `Asset` type members by adding a type `_tag: "Stock"` to `Stock` and `_tag: "House"` to `House`.

Let's rewrite the function `calculatePL` using a switch/case statement:

```ts
function calculatePL(asset: Asset): number {
  switch(asset._tag) {
    case "Stock": {
      return ...
    }
    case "House": {
      return ...
    }
  }
}
```

We can see that we don't need any custom type guard and the compiler is able to hint at us when we are not handling some of the cases.

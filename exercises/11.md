### Exercise 11

The second type we explore is `number` that in the `typescript` world represent a floating point number.

```ts
/**
 * Number
 */
export const myNumber: number = 0.5;
export const myNumberInt: number = 1;
```

We can compose numbers with the cleassical operators like `+` / `-` / `*` / `%` / `/`

Lets write one constant definition per each of the operators and test the result using a new test suite `primitives.test.ts`

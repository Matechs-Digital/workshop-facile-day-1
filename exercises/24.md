### Exercise 24

Map (as in ES6 Map) is used to represent a homogeneous key=>value mapping where keys are compared referentially

```ts
/**
 * Map
 */
export const myMap = new Map([
  ["a", 1],
  ["b", 2],
]);
```

Let's explore the `Map` methods and write tests for every method in it (`get`, `set`, `has`, `keys`, `values`, etc.)
